# hanzi_flashcards
(Experimental)  Producing printed flashcards for practicing reading and writing Chinese characters

## Why?

There are a number of applications that drill with flashcards.  I would like paper flashcards as
I would make for myself with handwriting. 

## From what? 

I am exporting cards from Pleco, an excellent Chinese dictionary program that
runs on iOS and Android.
